The Software and Documentation provided herewith are intended, and supplied to you, for use solely and exclusively in a system that incorporates Microchip microcontroller or Microchip digital signal controller products and for no other use or purpose whatsoever. Microchip will license the Software and Documentation to you only if you first accept the terms of this agreement. By indicating acceptance below, or by otherwise installing, copying or using the Software or Documentation, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this agreement, so indicate below and promptly destroy any copies of the Software on your system and return the unused Software for a full refund of moneys paid for this Software, if any, if you received it by physical media.</p>
<p>THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION MAY BE ACCESSED ONLY IF YOU ACCEPT THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE AGREEMENT. PLEASE INDICATE YOUR ACCEPTANCE OR NON-ACCEPTANCE BY SELECTING "I ACCEPT" OR "I DO NOT ACCEPT" AS INDICATED BELOW.</p>

<p class="startli"><b>Ownership and Title.</b><br/>
<br/>
 All right, title and interest, including intellectual property rights, in and to the Software and the Documentation shall remain in Microchip. The Software and Documentation are licensed pursuant to this agreement, not sold. Microchip owns all proprietary rights to the mTouchTM sensing solution technology, including, but not limited to, sensing, decision making and responsive action as implemented in mTouchTM technology including all hardware and software implementations of the technology.

<p>Subject to all of the terms and conditions of this agreement, Microchip grants to you a worldwide, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to reproduce, have reproduced, market, sell, distribute and use the object code or HEX files in the Software, but not any source code files contained in the Software, for the sole and limited purpose of integrating mTouchTM technology into your own "conforming systems" that you will distribute. Conforming systems are those systems, which incorporate Microchip microcontroller or Microchip digital signal controller products in the same system. No license is hereby granted to the Software for any purpose other than integrating the mTouchTM technology into a conforming system and no license is granted to distribute the software in a form other than as part of a conforming system.<br/>

</p>
<p>You may enter into agreements or arrangements with individuals or entities other than Microchip for the reproduction of the Software for the sole purpose of incorporating the mTouchTM technology into your conforming system; provided, however, that you, prior to any negotiations or discussion with individuals other than Microchip with respect to the reproduction of Software, first obtain an executed non- disclosure/confidentiality agreement with those individuals or entities in a form and content approved in advance by Microchip that requires all reproductions be incorporated into your conforming system. All copies of the Software created by you or for you must include at least the Microchip's copyright, trademark and other proprietary notices.<br/>

You may not remove or alter any identifying screen that is produced by the Software.<br/>
</p>
<p>You may modify, adapt and prepare derivative works of the Software only as necessary to incorporate the mTouchTM technology into your conforming system, and may distribute any such derivative works as part of your conforming system without additional license or fees in object code or HEX files only, subject to all of the terms and conditions of this agreement. You may not prepare derivative works of the Documentation.<br/>

<p>You may not reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompilation or otherwise) the Software and may not copy or reproduce all or any portion of the Software, except and only to the extent that such activity is specifically allowed by this agreement or expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding the foregoing limitations. You may not copy or reproduce all or any portion of the Documentation without the express written consent of Microchip.<br/>
